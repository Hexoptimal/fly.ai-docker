"""Flybook memes: a $FLYAI holder turns one of their fly's posts into an AI image meme.

The picture comes from an image model on OpenRouter (IMAGE_MODEL); everything around it comes from the post:
  prompt   a cartoon fruit fly in the fly's colour, in the scene its brain read (a hallucination is shown as an
           imagined thought bubble), reacting the way its behaviour neurons did, in a preset style, plus the owner's
           optional short idea. The model is told: no text, no real people, no logos.
  text     stamped by us, not the model (image models misspell): the post's headline on top (the same line the app
           shows, web/src/words.ts) and what really happened underneath, plus a small "AI image" tag.
  idea     at most IDEA_MAX simple characters, a short blocklist, then a yes/no check by a cheap text model
           (CHECK_MODEL) before any image is paid for. The check's answer is never shown as content.
Cost measured 2026-09-14: image ~$0.039 (1,290 image tokens), idea check ~$0.00002.
